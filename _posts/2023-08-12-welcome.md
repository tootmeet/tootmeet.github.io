title: Welcome to Tootmeet!
---

Tootmeet is a way to bring the global Mastodon community of developers, instance administrators, and power users together for education, collaboration, and discussion on topics that guide the development and adoption of Mastodon.
 
### How do the meetups work?

1. Proposed speakers choose a topic and category and set the date.
2. A Jitsi meeting is published for the meetup
3. At the meetup, speakers are given time to answer host questions and present on their topic. This part of the talk is recorded.
4. An open Q&A session follows. This part of the talk is not recorded.
5. The meetup is uploaded to the <a href="https://video.ploud.fr/c/tootmeet/videos">tootmeet channel on a peertube instance</a> and announced on social media.
